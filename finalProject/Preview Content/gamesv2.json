		"about": "HORIZON FORBIDDEN WEST: BURNING SHORES, a paid expansion for Horizon Forbidden West, takes players back to Guerrilla Games' far-flung future, which sees humanity struggling to survive in a world teeming with giant, animal-like machines. Having eliminated the immediate threat posed by the Zeniths -- a group of long-lived individuals who attempted to eradicate all life on the planet -- beloved Horizon hero Aloy learns that one final member of the faction may still be on Earth and is almost certainly up to no good. She travels to the Burning Shores (what's left of Los Angeles in the future) to confront him, meeting up with members of a tribe called the Quen, who have sailed across the ocean and are on the brink of collapse. Realizing that their goals align, Aloy works in cooperation with several Quen as she explores this dangerous new land. The expansion delivers not only an expansive new region for players to explore, but also additional machine foes, new weapons, armor, and abilities, plus new character developments, including a potential love interest for Aloy.",

It's a world overseen by the powers of Foresight, Knowledge, and Action. The peace and tranquility is suddenly shattered as magical portals open up throughout the realm and Piglin invasion forces pour forth from the Nether with the goal of corrupting the Overworld. To save this world, Foresight, Knowledge, and Action use their powers to reach out through all the realms to summon a hero with the traits and skills needed to drive the Piglin back to the Nether. That hero is you. You won't need to fight the Piglin forces alone, though. As you ride throughout the world, collecting resources and building up defenses to fend off Piglin attacks, your presence and actions will inspire others. Uniting the Overworld under your banner, you will command your own armies in battle against the Piglins. If you can drive back the Piglins and stop the corruption of the Overworld, the legacy you leave behind won't just be a story ... it will be the stuff of Legends.",

		"about": "I grew up playing this series over hundreds of hours.  It had at the time of its release a quite unique battle system (which only has been replicated in one other major game to date, One Step From Eden), lots of content, and decent stories.  Lan can be a bit mischievous, and like many young boys, isn't eager to do schoolwork, yet at times he is willing to lay down his life for his friends, along with his netnavi, Megaman.exe.  An important correction: the main character Lan doesn't become Megaman.  Megaman is a completely separate person who is guided through battles by Lan.  The bulk of the game is spent controlling Megaman.\n\nThere is tons of content in the games.  I spent hundreds of hours in the games in my youth and only 100%ed Battle Network 1.  However, going from game to game, the battle system and formula is very similar at its core.  Each game adds new mechanics and battle chips that keep things fresh across the series, and near the end of the series (5 and 6), the version differences are more significant.  Different characters show up, and while the story beats are similar, the gameplay can be dramatically affected based on which version you play.\n\nPositive content: Lan and Megaman repeatedly put themselves at risk to save others.  At the end of Battle Network 1, Mega Man downloads a program that allows him to completely sync with Lan.  Lan is willing to risk the chance that he will die if Megaman is deleted to save the world.  Self-sacrifice is a strong recurring theme in the series, along with the willingness to do what's right even if it seems hard.  Another theme is that of correcting mistakes.  Many times Lan makes mistakes that he must correct, some of which had serious consequences.  He is willing to go the distance to make things right.  Megaman follows Lan's orders in battles and on the net, but he tries to help Lan stay on the straight and narrow. \n\nAs for concerning content, there is suggestive dialogue at times, but never to an extreme.  Lan is implied to have cheated on homework.   Responding \"Hellz yeah\" to one person is required to complete Battle Network 2.  In Battle Network 2, Mega Man once faces off against and deletes programs that are not necessarily evil to obtain a program he can use to save the world.  In Battle Network 3, Lan trusts someone he shouldn't and makes a mistake that could have cost lives.  In 4 and 5, Megaman can use battle chips called \"dark chips\".  Upon using them outside of story requirement, he becomes corrupted; using one during a certain encounter is required to beat BN4.  The more Megaman uses the chips, the more evil he becomes.  In BN5, he is able to harness this \"darkpower\" in a way without becoming evil after a certain point in the story.  In BN6, Megaman struggles to stay himself when his natural urges become affected by absorbing the data of a \"Cybeast\".  He learns to control himself and his newfound power over time.   \n\nNote: In Battle Network 6, at the Virus Battler part (5 battles that reward rare battle chips), you must change the language to Japanese by the fifth battle in order to receive a certain chip required to 100% the game.  You can just compare your chip library to someone else that has the chip online, but it is recommended that you obtain the chip.",

		"about": "Developed by New Zealand's Black Salt Games and published by Team 17, DREDGE can best be described as a story-based fishing simulation. Weaving in adventure game elements, such as an inventory and characters to interact with (such as a Fishmonger, Mayor, and Shipwright), you awaken in a small fishing village after your ship is damaged. You inquire about work and set sail in a small boat to look for fish to catch and sell. If you damage the ship, such as bang into rocks and bust up the hull, you'll need to pay for repairs, too. Throughout this single-player game, you'll take on various quests for the locals, explore new locations, face off against all kinds of fish (and more malicious sea creatures), explore the ocean for artifacts, upgrade your boat and gear, and unravel a dark mystery. After all, there must bee a reason you are repeatedly warned to leave and forget this place. All the while, you must keep an eye on the time, and watch out for darkness and fog, which will impede your success. Note: Available for multiple platforms -- PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC -- Dredge looks and plays the same between them all, but with higher graphical fidelity on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.",

Laden with traps -- spikes, explosives, arrows, and more -- as well as monstrous genetically engineered guards, outposts must be successfully navigated in a single attempt, as even one point of damage will result in the hero's death and force the player to restart that level from scratch. Successfully completing a dungeon allows players to return to their base, spend earned resources on new guns, gear, and upgrades, and purchase plots of land on which you can design your own bases before sharing them with the rest of the game's community.",

		"about": "EVERSPACE 2 puts players in the cockpit of a customizable space fighter piloted by Adam, the last of a series of human clones who is trying to make his way through the galaxy working as a pilot for hire. The story begins with an ill-fated escort mission that sees Adam and a couple of teammates captured, then quickly escaping to a secret base where they work to regain their strength. The plot gradually thickens as Adam finds himself embroiled in conflicts involving multiple outlaw factions while making new friends and taking on allies who provide information and upgrades. Most of the game is spent flying a nimble, customizable fighter, with several missions set in deep space, in the atmosphere above planets, around belts of space rocks, and inside asteroid caves. It's not quite a seamless open galaxy, but rather a collection of locations you can quickly fly between at will as you unlock more areas to explore. Tasks include scouting assignments, aerial dogfights, and capital ship assaults. You'll also harvest loot from shipwrecks and asteroids that can be used to purchase and craft upgrades for Adam's ship, then install them in appropriate armor, weapon, and accessory slots between missions back at base. Players can expect around 40 hours of space opera action.",

As the daughter of the Minister of Oil in Petria, Zoe grew up as part of the elite circle of the upper class. Kaito's family, on the other hand, came from a family of hard workers, struggling to make a living under the authoritarian government. Still, despite coming from opposite worlds, the duo have become best friends. But now, that friendship will be put to the test as the duo skate their way through a tale of intrigue and political discourse, uncovering pieces of a conspiracy that could upend everything they thought they believed in and shatter the bonds between them.",

		"about": "Can you survive a treacherous new world that doesn't want you there? This is the premise behind PIKMIN 4, the latest in Nintendo's beloved strategy game series now available for Nintendo Switch. Similar to its predecessors, you find yourself on an Earth-like planet, and instead of playing as protagonists from previous games, for the first time in the franchise you can create your own hero with a couple of customization options, including body type, hair, and spacesuit color. To safely explore this world, solve challenges and remain protected against other creatures, you'll enlist the help of the tiny plantlike creatures, Pikmin. You'll have a much greater variety of Pikmin this time around (opposed to classic Red, Blue and Yellow), including Purple, Rock, White, Glow, Winged, and Ice Pikmin. Also new to the series is a loyal space dog, Oatchi, who can be incredibly useful as it sniffs out and digs to find hidden items you can use, smashes through obstacles, carries you and your Pikmin on its back and jumps to reach items and shortcuts (as an ant-sized creature, this can be quite helpful). Along with being able to attack enemies for you, Oatchi's abilities are also upgradeable. Pikmin 4 has a cooperative (co-op) option for two players to work together on the same screen, and additional content not found in the main campaign.",

The top-down camera helps prevent too much gore from being shown, and the blood overall isn’t much worse than what you would see in Elden Ring or games of that type. The nudity is also nigh-absent, save for a moderately racy outfit on the main villain, but it’s nothing work that’s what you would see in PG-13 movies. The atmosphere is beautiful and scary, and I really think it could be rated T.",

		"about": "Capcom has thrown down the latest chapter in its beloved 36-year-old 2-D fighting game franchise. STREET FIGHTER 6 was designed to build upon the familiar gameplay, which made the 50+ million selling series so popular, but also add new features and characters (like Luke), streamlined controls, extra modes (including a stronger focus on online multiplayer matches), and improved production values. Gamers can choose to play as or against 18 unique international characters, each with different play styles and moves, and with more characters planned post-launch, as optional downloadable content (DLC). Through punches, kicks and throws, as well as special (and magical) attacks using electricity or fire, the core gameplay is to inflict as much damage on an opponent as possible, and deplete their health bar until they've lost -- before they can do the same to you. New game modes include Fighting Ground, World Tour and Battle Hub, which are added to previous Street Fighter iterations, such as Arcade Mode, local versus battles and online matches, Training Mode, and more. Along with enhanced graphics that take advantage of the latest hardware, Street Fighter 6 adds the franchise's first-ever real-time commentary, with subtitles in 13 languages, by adding familiar Street Fighter voices, like Vicious and Aru, to narrate what is happening during the battle. Note: All versions of the game (console and PC) look and play in a similar fashion.",

		"about": "From Enhance Games, the same studio that created Rez and Tetris Effect, comes its latest puzzler, HUMANITY. In partnership with Japanese studio THA LTD., you control a Shiba Inu who must herd a massive, marching crowd of faceless humans across various intricate levels floating in the sky. The goal is to lead people to a glowing square, by placing down directional arrows for them to follow, when to jump to another platform, push blocks, avoid obstacles, and much more. If unsuccessful, the humans follow each other mindlessly, falling off ledges into the abyss, until you bark the right command to lead the horde to the end. As such, Humanity might best be described as a modern take on Lemmings. Played on a PlayStation 4 or 5, Windows PC, and with support for virtual reality (VR) headsets on all these machines, Humanity includes a deep Story mode and User mode/Stage Creator (currently in beta), which lets you make and share your own stages with others (or download other people's work, too). User-created levels support cross-platform play, therefore you can make a level on a PC but someone on a PS4 or PS5 can download and play it. Story mode gets more intricate over time, with themed levels, extra challenges (like blowing fans, laser guns, and switches you stand on), and huge fights between humans. All versions of the game look and play the same between them (with or without the optional VR support).",

Players jump into a car made of Lego bricks that instantly morphs into an all-terrain vehicle or boat whenever they veer off the road or into a lake. The open world is filled with challenges ranging from quick little races with weapon power-ups to weird quests, such as driving over robots carrying explosives or collecting escaped farm animals. Each race and quest earns experience, which grows your driver level and gradually unlocks more story missions. You'll also earn money as you go along, which can be spent on new vehicles, avatars, parts, and upgrades. When not racing, players can choose to build their own cars from scratch in one of the many garages dotting the landscape, carefully choosing and placing each individual brick to create the Lego car of their dreams. Outside the story, players can invite friends or join public games for individual races and series cups.",

They're joined by special elemental creatures called triggers that assist them in battle. Players spend part of their time exploring towns, talking to folks to further the story, and buying and crafting items. The rest is spent wandering the overworld and working through dungeons teeming with enemies and secret treasures. Battles take place in real time and are viewed from a raised perspective, with players simply needing to run around and tap buttons to attack or dodge, occasionally unleashing superpowered abilities when an energy meter fills. Players can also tap a trigger to switch between heroes at will, allowing them to take advantage of each character's special abilities on command.",

Depending on how mature you think your child is I would recommend 13+ but for more immature children 15+. The game is an amazing game and I think more people should try out the game for themselves. The flesh system is amazing, we haven't seen anything like it in gaming yet, well maybe if you think about the doom games but nothing tops this. The flesh system includes realistic melting, slice marks, stomping, putting holes through zombies, decapitation, and body trauma, and if beaten a zombie enough(or shooting, slicing, and melting) you can see the insides of the zombies. I think for this day and age it's an amazing feature. Also in certain areas, you can see blood splatter, zombies with their insides outside, and also dead bodies. It can be a pretty boring game at times, I enjoy fast-paced action such as dying light. Also to parents, don't be worried.",

After an experiment fueled by summer vacation boredom goes wrong, Nobita, a young Japanese boy, finds himself on a strange new planet. He's joined by a cast of friends, including Doraemon, Sneech, Big G, and Sue. When their spaceship crash lands, they meet Lumis, a young boy who lives on a run-down farm. Because the group is unable to return home on a broken-down ship, Lumis invites them to stay with him on the farm. As long as they can help out with farm work, they can stay as long as they need to. Grateful, Doraemon, Noby, and their friends agree. Soon after this, Doraemon returns to the crash site to find the ship has been taken. Two royal guards admit to taking the ship at the request of the Queen. A frustrated Doraemon and friends visit the Castle to learn more, only to discover that the Queen is actually Lumis' mother. Lumis' mother is skeptical of the Earthlings, refuses to return their ship, and threatens to arrest Doraemon. Lumis demands that the group be given a chance to prove their worth, so the Queen agrees ad allows them to go free. As a result, it's up to Lumis and the group to improve the farm and build up the town to convince the Queen to accept them and hopefully give the ship back so the group can return home.",

Mario, his friends, and his new Rabbid allies have just started to unwind from their last heroic odyssey when another epic adventure literally falls from the sky in the form of \"Sparks,\" strange new hybrids that are part Rabbid and part Luma. These mysterious new creatures are being hunted by Cursa, an evil entity bent on absorbing the power of the Sparks and using that power to spread its Darkmess corruption throughout the universe. To rescue the Sparks and put a stop to Cursa's scheme, Mario, his friends, and their Rabbid doppelgangers will need to travel throughout the galaxy, freeing various planets and their people on their way to Cursa's stronghold. Along the way, they'll discover some new and familiar faces willing to join the fight against a common foe, as well as the hidden secret behind Cursa and the Darkmess.",

		"about": "A classic adventure has finally come back to consoles and computers with RETURN TO MONKEY ISLAND. Taking place years after the last Monkey Island game (a franchise that first debuted in 1990), this new tale questions whether or not hapless hero Guybrush Threepwood did in fact discover the secrets of Monkey Island (despite the name of one of the old games). What was revealed, and what happened with Threepwood's nemesis LeChuck, a \"zombie ghost pirate\"? How do all the other characters fit into this narrative? All the major players are back, and so are new faces, in Return to Monkey Island, where you're once  again tasked with traveling to the Caribbean islands, commandeering a ship (if you can find a crew!), collecting and manipulating items, solving puzzles, and interacting with a motley crew of characters (it features several thousand lines of dialogue). After a tutorial-like introduction in which you control Threepwood's young son, who's playing with friends, you familiarize yourself with the game mechanics and controls before the main story kicks off.",

Invited by her mother, the lead nurse, to help out around the hospital, Casey instead intends to interview the staff and patients in order to find out as much as she can about the mysterious airship before her three-day holiday is over and she has to return to school. As Casey begins her investigation, she realizes that perhaps the most fascinating mysteries aren't what she initially thought as the hospital's staff and patients go about their daily lives and Casey learns more about each resident. An unexpected death rattles some of the patients as they come to grips with their own lives and how they're spending their time with themselves and others. Life at the hospital happens quickly, and it's up to Casey to figure out where her time is best spent and whose journey she wants to follow.",

Eventually, Gerda's husband is accused of blowing up a factory that the Nazis operated within, and Gerda's life is turned upside down as he's taken away. Being unsure of who she can trust and having no clue as to how she can save her husband, Gerda has to use whatever resources she can to persevere – and, if she can, perhaps even liberate her small town.

		"about": "MLB THE SHOW 23 brings the Boys of Summer back onto the field for a new season of baseball along with some special surprises for fans of the sport. The largest addition to the game is the inclusion of the Storylines mode, which focuses on the Negro Leagues and eight of its most influential athletes. Their stories, and the history behind their accomplishments, are detailed with additional documentary footage from Bob Kendrick, the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Alongside Jackie Robinson, other stars like John Donaldson and Andrew \"Rube\" Foster are included, and the mode drops players in the midst of legendary moments in each athlete's life, like the pitching duel between Satchel Paige and Martin Dihigo. Completing their stories not only unlocks the combined story of that star, but provides them as players for your Diamond Dynasty team, which is the fantasy baseball mode for the game. But they won't solely be operating as standalone stars on your squad. This year's Dynasty adds a new Captains feature, allowing you to theme a squad around a leader who boosts their stats based on the number of players they have from their squad. For example, the more Yankees players that you have on a squad anchored by Derek Jeter, the larger the bonuses to your power swings and arm strength when fielding the ball. In fact, there's more than 180 legends of the game that have been added, so you should be able to find plenty of people to build a squad around. Squads can also be boosted by the on-field play of an athlete in real time, supercharging their stats higher than their initial cards to reflect their breakout performances. For international fans of the game, you'll also have the option to represent a country with the World Baseball Classic, choosing to represent teams from Puerto Rico, Israel, Japan, and others. Fans that want to get closer to the game than ever before can also choose to scan their faces via mobile app, then transfer that scan onto their created player so they feel more connected to the Road to the Show than ever before. Past that, there are new stadium presentations and options to build your team's park, new Jumbotron animations, and game commentary.",

		"about": "In STORYTELLER, the pen is truly mightier than the sword. In this unique reactive puzzle game, it's up to you to take key story elements and piece them together to craft quirky tales centered on a series of given themes. You're in control of the narrative, as you place each available character or setting in the comic book styled panels to match the page's plot description. Just keep in mind that there's usually more than one way for a story to unfold. A well placed plot twist might shake things up and still meet the criteria. Your tale could be a heartfelt romance filled with loves lost and found. Or maybe a classic monster horror is more to your liking to fit the bill. Why stop there? You could combine the two ideas and regale your readers with the legend of how a lonely monster found its true love. With a diverse roster full of literary characters and a range of themes at your disposal, you're free to experiment and find your own unique interpretation. After all, you are the author and it's your story to tell.",

		"about": "BAYONETTA ORIGINS: CEREZA AND THE LOST DEMON is the latest chapter in the popular action/adventure franchise, but it takes a different twist for this new chapter in the Umbran Witch's story. As the title implies, the game is centered around the early years of her life, when Bayonetta was known as Cereza. Her parents, from rival clans, fell in love, which was a strictly forbidden act. As a result, her father was exiled, her mother was imprisoned, and Cereza was branded as an outcast. Seeking to find a way to free her mother from her unjust punishment, Cereza studies magic with another outcast witch until one night, when she has a dream where a white wolf and a boy promise to give her the power she seeks if she'll explore Avalon Forest, a magical glade dominated by fairies. But Cereza isn't strong enough to go on her own, and even one of her own summoning spells backfires in a spectacular way, tying a young demon to the body of her stuffed toy. With the two unlikely characters now bound to each other, Cereza and her new demon have to explore the forest, fighting fairies and other magical creatures in an effort to gain the power they seek to set things right. Players will control both Cereza and Cheshire, her toy/demon, at the same time as they explore various sections of the forest, solving puzzles and unlocking new areas to travel through. In combat, Cereza will rely upon her magic to bind and trap enemies, while Cheshire will use his claws and teeth to defeat monsters. Will Cereza and Cheshire be able to find the power they need to save Cereza's mother?",

As they travel, the duo must find ways to work together to make it through the harsh weather and to overcome all manner of obstacles. Players will make their way through the beautiful hand-drawn world, controlling either the cub or fawn and guiding them through their heartfelt journey.",

		"about": "Me parece demasiado quisquilloso el pegi +12. Los gráficos son estética cartoon, dibujos animados, los niños son capaces de diferenciarlo de la realidad totalmente.\nEl juego tiene combates pero son contra robots, a \"mamporrazos\" y de nuevo los efectos son estilo comic, no hay sangre ni efectos desagradables que un niño de 7 años no vea en cualquier programa de clan a diario en la tv.\nNo hay ninguna escena de muerte (no lo he terminado aún) que sea violenta, ni siquiera desagradable, se representan como simples \"mareos\" o explosiones en el caso de los robots.\nLa historia sí es un poco más adulta porque trata de la manipulación de la gente mediante la tecnología de consumo y  los niños no lo van a entender, pero tampoco es una historia oscura ni que pueda crear ningún tipo de problema en ellos.\nEl juego en sí, pues tiene bastantes tramos de juego de plataformas, más o menos complicado, llegas a una zona de combate, eliminas enemigos, más plataformas, más enemigos... y así hasta llegar hasta el jefe final de cada capítulo. Todo ello con mucha incidencia en que sigas el ritmo de la música, para golpear, para esquivar, para plataformear, para moverte... cuanto más a ritmo lo hagas mejor te saldrá.\nVisualmente un espectáculo, parece que estás jugando una serie de dibujos animados, todos los detalles muy cuidados, todo se mueve al ritmo de la música... hay que verlo, mezclado con un humor sencillito pero resultón.\n\nComo digo, aunque sea PEGI +12 no veo problemas en que jueguen niños algo más pequeños, eso sí, con los padres al lado, como en todos los videojuegos, por supuesto.",

Choosing from four samurai classes, players will journey across the islands, using a variety of methods to come out on top. Whether it's Ayaka (discard and attack), Kaito (multi-enemy defense), Sota (lures, poison, and stealth), or Misaki (trickery and deception), players will start with six basic cards and build out their deck by finding cards on the grid-based map, buying new cards with gold, and upgrading and removing cards via special buildings that best fits a particular playstyle. This is an ordeal you may not be prepared for as every turn could be your last if you aren't making the most out of managing your time and deck to overcome the coming corruption. Or perhaps you're more resilient? Are you up to the challenge?",

Centuries after her defeat, Lilith, the Mother of Demons, has risen once more due to the machinations of Doctor Faustus and his Hydra forces. With Lilith's return, an ancient prophecy is set in motion, one that tells of a world plunged into darkness and re-created as a literal hell on earth. A different type of hero will be required to fend off the coming apocalypse. Enter the Midnight Suns, a diverse group of heroes with experience in the realm of the supernatural and those best suited to fight back against Lilith's demonic minions. Aiding in their battle is The Hunter, Lilith's half-human, half-demon offspring, resurrected to once again stand against their mother. As The Hunter, you will join forces with some of Marvel's mightiest heroes as you chip away at Lilith's plans in epic comic book team-ups, utilizing each hero's unique abilities and powers in strategic turn-based battles. In between missions, you'll explore the grounds of The Abbey, your interdimensional base operations, getting to know your fellow teammates and building bonds of friendship that will add to your synergy on the battlefield. Because only together do you have a chance to stop Lilith once and for all.",

		"about": "Resident Evil: Village is a fine addition to a very graphic game series. This is a video game made to be played by adults. RE VIll has multiple F-bombs throughout gameplay and is incredibly graphic in its violence. Players have to fight zombies and other monsters, usually requiring several gruesome gunshots or knife stabs. A character gets half their hand bitten off (graphically shown on screen) and screams in agony for several minutes afterward. The monsters are terrifying and will chase the player relentlessly, providing plenty of thrills. The storytelling is beautiful, and the gameplay and graphics are equally as fantastic. Though, admittedly, the blood and violence were a bit too much for even me to handle.",

		"about": "Hitman 3 is the finale of the world of assasination trilogy and it knocks it out of the park (with the exception of one certain epilogue that will go nameless that stupidly took up a spot in the 6 map lineup). It’s a great game. Now, when you hear a title like hitman 3, I’m sure it sets off some red flags in your head, but this title is kinda misleading. Now don’t get me wrong, it is a game about killing, but it’s not your standard call of duty shooter, in fact it isn’t a shooter at all, it’s a puzzle game. In the game you play as an agent of a top secret organization called the ICA, the ICA’s job is to dispatch of people on behalf of clients, now, you don’t go killing random people, you’re strictly killing bad guy’s, over the top bond like bad guy’s (now keep this comparison to the bond franchise in mind, I’ll bring it up later). You play as the iconic character agent 47 (red tie and all), you work with your handler Diana Burnwoord to kill these over the top villainy villians, untill… well… I don’t want to spoil the game for you… Anyway, you travel to exotic international locations to kill your targets, you go to places like a giant gold tower above the clouds in dubai, the rainy neon streets of China where you’ll find some shady business dealings going on, a seedy busting nightclub in Berlin, or a wine vineyard in Argentina, and much much more, these locations are gorgeous, they are these big detailed open maps that you are let into to dispatch of your targets as creatively as possible. These maps also have some really cool concepts attached to them, for example, you travel to a manor on the English countryside where a murder has taken place (not by you), your job in this map is to solve the murder and to find your target, this mission is really cool and creative. In this game you have to use your brain to dispatch of your targets, you can’t just run up to your target and shoot him/her/they, if you do that you’ll immediately get gunned down by guards, you die real quick in this game, instead you have to plot your own perfect crime, you have to peice together enviormental details, npc conversations, different npc schedules, all sorts of stuff, when people say this game has educational value that’s what they’re talking about, this game really requires you to think. Now, lets get to what your here for.\n\nLet’s talk about the rating of this game, it is rated M for blood, language, and substances. •The blood/Violence. The blood is very tame, almost non existent, you actively have to go out of your way to look for it, plus, this game is special, where you are heavily punished for killing non targets (I know you saw in the trailer common sense listed on the page, that the character was going around shooting people, this is very misleading), you loose points for killing non targets, these points are used to unlock new weapons, starting locations, outfits, and tools, loosing points is frustrating, trust me. The violence in this game is also pretty tame, kills in this game aren’t as gruesome as you might think, in fact they are usually really silly, for example, in the dubai map, you can dispatch of a target who is about to go skydiving by tampering with his parachute, you can already tell how its gonna go, it’s all topped of by a cheesy one liner by the straight faced agent 47. Most of the kills in this game are like this, largely bloodless and silly. Another thing to note is how darkly hilarious this game is, some of these kills man, this game has an amazing silly sense of dark humor.\n• For the language, it is very far and in between, in fact it’s almost non existent, I only heard one F-bomb in the entire game, in a game with nearly 25 hours worth of gameplay content, think about it. Pg-13 movies are allowed to say 2 F bombs, I only heard one in my total of 30 hours playing the game (yes I know, that’s alot, I have alot of time on my hands when the kids are busy). Now, I did hear some sh-ts and some hells, but as stated before, Pg-13 movies can say and do alot worse, for example, the Marvel movies have sh-ts and hells galore.\n•For substances, it’s all social drinking, Npc’s in crowds will be slowly sipping a glass of wine, no one is getting drunk or going crazy, it’s really quite tame.\n\nConclusion, if this game were a movie it would be pg-13, the only reason this game is rated M is for the language, and even that is basically non existent (except for the one F-bomb I heard). It’s very comparable to the Danial Creig Bond movies, if your kids can watch those movies, they can easily play this game. Dont listen to commen sense media’s review, their ratings tend to be very over exaggerated and conservative. Plus this game has some good educational value. I hope this review helped you make your decision. Have a great rest of your day, thank you.",

As for drugs, you can avoid all drinking and smoking completely. People might get scared becuase drugs is so high but each \"drug\" you take gives you a power up (health, slo mo, ect). For language just turn on the language filter, I bet your kids hear more swear words at school. For nudity just disable it in settings. Overall this game deserves a 12+",

		"about": "Parents need to know that there are three different modes in this game: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. There isn't very much blood or gore except in the Zombies mode. Most people will play Call of Duty for the Multiplayer, which is a mode where you play against other players. This game has lots of explosive action and shooting. It is very intense, but not very bloody. The zombies mode is pretty scary and gory, but lots of fun. Working together with teammates is really necessary in order to win. Shooting zombies will always spray blood and when you shoot a zombie's head or limb it will get blasted off. The  Campaign has occasional uses of F--k and Sh-t but it is not very often. There are some disturbing parts in the campaign, but not as much as the previous game. Sometimes you will stab people or choke them out, so this mode is more mature then the Multiplayer mode. Most teens can handle it. I would recommend the Multiplayer mode for age 13, Campaign for age 15, and zombies for age 16. Parents should also know that content such as the blood and cursing can be turned off in the settings. However there will still be lots of shooting and explosions. Thanks for reading.",

It’s not like they don’t know that these things exist or haven’t seen them. And let’s be real, if you’ve been on the internet you’ve almost definitely seen pornography. This game does have some good role models and is one of the best games my daughter and I have ever played.

Blood and gore is infrequent though, most violence is acted upon monsters, with non-red blood or no blood at all, however it does involve dismemberment of aforementioned monsters, but them being monsters and with the aforementioned blood description, it all looks very cartoony.\nLANGUAGE: 7/10 Infrequent bad language but the word f**k is probably the most used across the game.\nSEX: 3/10 One reference to it where the word f**k is used in a sexual context.\nTHERE ARE NO OTHER FORMS OF INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT",

		"about": "This game is a well thought out project put out by Activison and the call of duty franchise. I always look at common sense media before I buy my son any games or let him watch any movies. Typically I steer away from call of duty games for him because of the M rating for 17+. After doing some research about this game and watching gameplay footage I realized it is not that bad of a game. Call of duty is required to put this rating because of the gore that can be visualized and the language. However, you can turn off the language for younger audience. Also there is a setting that turns off the blood and gore in the game. I turned this off for my 15 year old so he can still enjoy the game without seeing too much violence. I believe that this game is great and there should be no problem with anyone 14 or older playing this game. If you are a parent and you are still hesitant you should watch some of the gameplay footage. It definitely changed my mind! I know that call of duty is known for being a gruesome game and very violent but it is not like that at all. My son loves this game and I have also enjoyed playing it with him.",

		"about": "This is a great game which is good for kids 11 and older because while their is a fair bit of gore it is very undersized and fast paced making the player really miss the brunt of it. I bought this game 3 weeks ago and have been learning to play it and really it is just a great game and as for language it is not bad at all similar to movies like kingsman but with half as many cuss words. With the gore being so unrealistic and hidden players are most likely to focus on the large hordes of zombies coming in. Zombie fans will be delighted with this game and it is totally ok for kids over 11. Also it is worth noting that this game received a game of the year award and it is still marketing for only 40 dollars (Australian). The charcters can also be great role models as the game promotes teamwork strongly and encourages players to work together with friends and AI teammates having consequences for straying or losing communication.",

Heroes from both sides engage in frantic five vs. five (5v5) battles, casting spells, summoning creatures, clashing swords, and firing guns in defense of their Guardian, all while trying to create an opening to attack their opponent's Guardian in kind. This is a fantasy war of titanic proportions for the fate of the world. With stakes this high, the battle for survival isn't just big ... it's Gigantic.",

		"about": "Free online, STARCRAFT is a real-time strategy game originally released in 1998. This new download also includes the Brood War expansion pack. Players command one of three species -- the Terrans (humans), Protoss, and the insect-like Zerg -- and must compete for total galactic domination. Each of these three species features its own unique tactics, technology, units, weapons, and their own perspective of the overall story. So it's essential to employ different strategies for each species based on these variables. The single-player campaign comes with more than 30 nail-biting missions for each game across multiple environments, including entertaining cut scenes to bridge the action. Players will collect resources such as blue crystal minerals needed to fuel their objectives, plus create and train new recruits, construct varied units, develop new technologies, and battle offensively and defensively against uncompromising enemy species. Multiplayer can be waged against up to eight opponents, with a number of gameplay modes and worldwide rankings. For unlimited replayability, StarCraft also features an easy-to-use campaign editor that allows gamers to edit units, create their own scenarios and maps, and effortlessly trade them online.",

The Microbe Games are a series of mazes where you steer a microbe through an environment by helping it find food and avoiding predators. The Ecoland Games provide different scenarios where you are given goals and a limited amount of time and resources. Trial and error is the key to success. You can also create your own simulations called \\\"Mods\\\" to share with others.",

From hiding in plain sight and blending into human society to being forced to scatter and fight one another in the shadows, all the factions scramble to be the dominant force, each believing they're the ones that have a fighting chance to preserve their people. Meanwhile, The Second Inquisition (groups of human hunters seeing this divide as the perfect opportunity), springs into action to rid the world of the vampiric menace for good. You, the player, are tasked with choosing a faction and doing whatever it takes to keep vampirekind from extinction—through violence against not only the desperate struggles of rival factions, but against the humans who want nothing more than to see you wiped off the face of the earth.",

During his journey, the player will need to make difficult choices on Little Fox's behalf that may impact his future. Does he act bravely? Is he generous? Does he behave impulsively or thoughtfully? These decisions shape his personality and future.

However later on you will see and understand why other maybe just bit more experienced players were so angry at you, there are nice players so don´t  get scared just mute those toxic ones. If you just can´t take this try to play it with friends, group of 5 can have really nice time plaiyng.

It's up to players to stop this nefarious plan. As the Tenno, descendants of an ancient warrior race, players will infiltrate Alad V's sprawling (and newly redesigned) Gas City on Jupiter and destroy the Amalgams – Alad V's monstrous new hybrids. They'll also face off with a new boss monster, a huge flying Sentient called the Ropalolyst. Players who defeat this winged behemoth can earn the blueprints of a powerful new support Warframe (biomechanical battle armor) called The Wisp which grants players the ability to float invisibly in the air, teleport, and shock and burn enemies. In addition to new Gas City graphics and a new Warframe, players can earn new weapons, mods, and cosmetics, and team up for the new endless co-op multiplayer mode, Disruption.",

		"about": "This app is very well designed, and, very importantly by education professionals. It is engaging and has my child excited about doing the math problems. My 5 year old had no problem with any of the content counting adding and subtracting numbers less than 10 which allowed several hours of play (~ 4 hours or so).  The app teaches helping others (e.g. help this character count the numbers) . My son has now run into more difficult problems , such as adding subtracting two digit numbers, and will need more math education before he can continue, but he enjoyed the numbers less than 10 content greatly, and without parent involvement. Also it is great that everything has audio (not just text which requires reading) , my son can read, but it would be tiring to read and play at the same time for him, as we've learned with many other apps.",

		"about": "Developed alongside the hard-hitting documentary The Undocumented, THE MIGRANT TRAIL explores the subject of Mexican migrants who hire people called 'coyotes' to lead them across the border through rough Arizona country. Players will see this controversial problem from two sides: the border patrol officers who scour the desert for migrants and the migrants themselves, who risk capture and death due to exposure, exhaustion, and injury to find better lives on the other side of the border. The three officers whose boots players inhabit have slightly varying views about and reasons for doing their job. Players have the opportunity to choose whether these officers help and apprehend suffering migrants or leave them behind in the desert to keep looking for able-bodied travellers. But the bulk of the experience is spent as a dozen different migrants, all of whom have stories relating reasons why their perilous journey may be worth the risk. As migrants players start by purchasing supplies for their trek, then head out on the trail -- presented as a top-down map of a desert with branching paths -- where they run into one trying and potentially lethal situation after another.",

		"about": "When my ten-year-old first asked for this game, I was skeptical. Sure, this game looked tame enough, but I wasn’t sure if he would have access to the main game. After some consideration, I purchased it, but I played some of it before giving it to him. I was astonished by the detail and educational content in this game. There were lessons and tests, and my son would frequently run up to me with new facts about the Ancient Greek world to share. Even though there is a collection of lessons about Ancient Greek battles, it was presented as flags with various symbols on them.  If you are concerned about nudity or sex, the game has nude statues, but nothing is sexualized or graphic. This made my child eager to learn and to explore the fascinating world of Ancient Greece. I would rate this game a 6/5 if I could; it’s just so phenomenal. I hope this review helped you.\n\nP.S. This game has some vocabulary your children might not understand. Just be aware that your child may need to be a little sophisticated.",

You're also supposed to collide with as many gold asteroids as possible, but it's often technically possible to clear the level without that being the primary goal. Each planet has special challenges, tools to use, and additional obstacles to overcome. These include utilizing gravity and velocity, firing rockets and lasers, moving space objects and planets, changing density, and even making wormholes and black holes. Kids will use their knowledge of astrophysics to complete levels, but not to worry: The game teaches them everything they need to know about Newton's Laws, mass, and angular momentum as they play.",

Ariel and Prince Eric have recently wed, and she's learning to embrace life as a human. There are some swimming games wherein she returns to mermaid form, seeking out household treasures and gems while avoiding obstacles and sea creatures. She and Prince Eric learn to dance together as players practice counting up and down. They also go for a carriage ride following a path laid out by certain shapes. Collected gems unlock dresses, hats, purses, and other accessories for Ariel to wear.",

		"about": "Once known for its picturesque boardwalks and quaint streets, the island town of Redfall is now the feasting grounds for vampires. This is the grim premise behind Arkane Studios' Redfall, a first-person action game that has you assume the role of one of four vampire hunters -- either played solo or in cooperative (co-op) multiplayer mode with up to three others online -- and face off against a legion of the undead. Along with staying alive and killing vampires (and other threats, like deadly cultists), with each fighter's unique weapons and abilities, you'll also find out what happened in Redfall, how the vampire goddess (known as Black Sun) managed to block the solar system's star, and what caused the viral plague to begin with. You'll also unravel backstories to each of the squad members you'll play as. Heroes include Devinder \"Dev\" Crousley, a paranormal investigator and aspiring inventor; Layla Ellison, a biomedical engineer with telekinetic powers; Remi de la Rosa (and robot cohort, Bribón) determined to help Redfall's survivors; and Jacob Boyer, a former military sharpshooter with a mysterious vampiric eye. While traveling across the island, you'll collect items to help you along the way, customize new gear and upgrade your hero's abilities, and figure out your preferred playstyle, whether it's a \"run and gun\" or something more stealthy and slower-paced. Note: Both the Xbox Series S/X and Windows PC versions of the Bethesda-published game look and play in a similar fashion, but computer gamers can play with a mouse and keyboard control, if preferred.",
